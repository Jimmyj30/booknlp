The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another 
his mother called him “WILD THING!” and Max said “I’LL EAT YOU UP!”
so he was sent to bed without eating anything.

That very night in Max’s room a forest grew and grew
and grew until his ceiling hung with vines
and the walls became the world all around

and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max
and he sailed off through night and day

and in and out of weeks
and almost over a year
to where the wild things are.

And when he came to the place where the wild things are
they roared the if terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth
and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws

til Max said “BE STILL!”
and tamed them with the magic trick

of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
and made him king of all wild things.

“And now, cried Max, "let the wild rumpus start!"

“Now stop!” Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper.
And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.
